    <div class="groupx"><img src="./Images/Image/groupx.jpg" alt="aa"></div>
    </p>
    <p class="mian-group">Is it necessary to hire a personal trainer (PT) to guide your workout? In fact, working out at
      the gym with a PT offers many benefits:
    <ul>
      <li>Reducing your risk of injury: Understanding the exercises and techniques from the PT will help you truly avoid
        the possibility
        of injury during exercise and optimize the benefits of the exercises</li>
      <li>Getting familiar with the gym quickly: You are new and tend to not like new things. The trainer will lay the
        groundwork for you,
        push you to start exercising and maintain a regular routine.</li>
      <li>Making your workout more diverse: Trainers will provide more creative exercises to make working out
        interesting for you. Working out
        at the gym for new people will become more fun when you don't have to repeat boring exercises.</li>
      <li>Helping you use your time effectively: they will help you save a lot of time that you wasted before by
        exercising improperly and inefficiently.</li>
      <li>Personalizing your gym workout program: assessing your fitness level, health conditions. Thus, helping you
        build a suitable exercise routine and a
        balanced diet to improve the effectiveness of your gym workout.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mian-group1">The solution to prevent laziness in newcomers to the gym is to find a companion.</p>
    <p class="mian-group">It's very interesting when you and your friend go to the gym together, both of you will
      motivate each other a lot during the training process. Instead of inviting each other to eat dishes that make you
      gain weight, excess fat, why don't you both work out diligently together to have a beautiful body and better
      health. Science has also proven that when you work out at the gym with someone, it significantly enhances the
      effectiveness of the workout, more than twice as much as when you work out alone. At the same time,
      having a companion will remind you to be more diligent and to eat more properly.</p>
