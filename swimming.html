      Swimming for health training? Here are the recommended swimming
      exercises by Speedo
    </p>
    <p class="font-content-center">
      There’s a reason so many Australians rate swimming as their favourite
      exercise routine. A swimming training program is low impact and can be
      enjoyed at any age, it builds both cardiovascular fitness and endurance,
      and all you need to get started are a good pair of goggles, swimmers and
      a swim cap.
    </p>
    <div class="img1">

    </div>
    <p class="font-content-left">
      It can be tough to know how long to swim to get a good workout. Speedo
      cares deeply about this sport, and we’ve developed a routine that will
      meet you where you are. If you’ re just starting out and looking for a
      swim workout for beginners, try one of our simple programs that will
      help you to build strength and develop a good feel for the water. For
      those who regularly swim for fitness, Speedo’s intermediate swim sets
      will challenge you and introduce new concepts to shake things up. If
      you’re a serious swimmer or need a swim workout for a triathlon,
      competition or ocean race, then look to our advanced swim workouts to
      build speed and endurance. Intermediate and advanced swim workouts would
      benefit from some swim gear to kick things up a notch. Every swim
      training program includes a warm up, main set and cool down. Some people
      do a swim workout for weight loss or to cross train for other sports.
      Others just love the feeling of starting their day gliding through
      water. Whether you are eight years old or 80, there’s never a better
      time than today to dive on in.
    </p>
    <p class="font-sub-title-center">1. Warm Up on Dry Land</p>
    <p class="font-content-left">
      The sport places demands on the legs (calves in particular), back, and
      shoulder, says Brian Towin, a physical therapist in Atlanta who
      specializes in swimming. Stave off leg cramps with sprinters' moves:
      Stand a few feet in front of a wall and, using it as support, step one
      foot back and bend front leg. Switch, then pull each leg to your butt
      for a quad stretch. Prep your back with side bends: Stand with feet
      together, arms overhead, pressing palms together, and tilt torso to each
      side. For the hsoulders, press palms into the small of your back,
      fingertips up, draw elbows toward each otehr and raise your chest. And
      shoulder rolls work, too, but don't go Micahel Phelps aggressive. Bend
      elbows at 90 degrees, point fingerrtips toward the ceiling, and rotate
      shoulders in both directions. 
    </p>
    <p class="font-sub-title-center">2. Relax</p>
    <div class="img1">
      <img style="width: 60vw; height: auto;" src="./Images/Image/swimming4.png" alt="" />
    </div>
    <p class="font-content-left">
      "Tense muscles sink like rocks, whereas releaxed muscles act more like
      buoys," says Andey Sean kershaw, head swim coach at the University of
      Miami. Just as important is to maintain a neutral positiion with your
      head, shoulders, and glutes in a line. It takes strain off your neck and
      back and helps you swim more gracefully. And it'll cue you to stay
      parallel in the water. "Your body works like a teeter-totter—if your
      head comes up, your hips go down," Kershaw says. Breathing plays a key
      role in this. As you get better at it, the pattern becomes its own
      meditation to keep you chill (and clears your head). 
    </p>
    <p class="font-sub-title-center">3. Focus on Form</p>
    <p class="font-content-left">
      since you took swimming lessons as a kid, there's been a change of
      thinking on best technique, Kershaw says. The pros have traded big,
      sweeping arm pulls for a tighter, linear patter. Picture your body
      shooting past your hands, the same way you plant your palms on the pool
      edge and push through your amrs to get out of the water. Here's how it's
      done: Your arm should enter the water just in front of your head,
      starting with teh tip of the middle finger. Extend it straight so your
      palm faces the bottom of the pool Bend wrist slightly like you're
      reacing into a cookie jar and pull your elbow back along your side,
      keeping your hand parallel to your body. Pair that motion with tight,
      rolling kicks, keeping legs fairly straight, three kicks for each pull
      (or six kicks per stroke cycle). 
    </p>
    <p class="font-sub-title-center">4. Go the Distance</p>
    <p class="font-content-left">
      Pools are usually short course (25 meters) or Olympic distance (50
      meters). Short pools are good for aerobic sprint interval training, Mabe
      says, whereas Olympic ones can help you prep for triathlon or open-water
      swims, since you're going twice as far without a respite. If you find
      yourself in a longer pool and want a high-intensity workout, use the
      painted marking below you (or on the ceiling if you're doing backstroke)
      to split up the laps between fast bursts and recovery. 
    </p>
    <p class="font-sub-title-center">5. Float On</p>
    <p class="font-content-left">
      Just like a land workout, you'll want ot change things up and isolate
      different muscle groups. A kickboard will help you target legs either
      during a warm-up or between sprints, Mabe says. Don fins if you want
      your upper body to do the heavy lifting. (And advanced swimmers can
      practice laps while keeping legs still.)
