    <p class="font-heading-content">Swimming</p>
    <p class="font-heading-sexydance">Swimming for health training? Here are the recommended swimming exercises by
      Speedo</p>
    <p class="mian-swimming">There’s a reason so many Australians rate swimming as their favourite exercise routine.
      A swimming training program is low impact and can be enjoyed at any age, it builds both cardiovascular fitness and
      endurance,
      and all you need to get started are a good pair of goggles, swimmers and a swim cap.</p>
    <div class="zumba"><img src="./Images/Image/swimming01.jpg" alt=""></div>
    <p class="mian-swimming">It can be tough to know how long to swim to get a good workout. Speedo cares deeply about
      this sport,
      and we’ve developed a routine that will meet you where you are. If you’
      re just starting out and looking for a swim workout for beginners, try one of our simple programs that will help
      you to build
      strength and develop a good feel for the water. For those who regularly swim for fitness, Speedo’s intermediate
      swim sets will
      challenge you and introduce new concepts to shake things up. If you’re a serious swimmer or need a swim workout
      for a triathlon,
      competition or ocean race, then look to our advanced swim workouts to build speed and endurance. Intermediate and
      advanced swim workouts would benefit
      from some swim gear to kick things up a notch. Every swim training program includes a warm up, main set and cool
      down.
      Some people do a swim workout for weight loss or to cross train for other sports. Others just love the feeling of
      starting their day gliding through water.
      Whether you are eight years old or 80, there’s never a better time than today to dive on in.</p>
    <p class="font-heading-sexydance">1. Warm Up on Dry Land</p>
    <p class="mian-swimming">The sport places demands on the legs (calves in particular), back, and shoulder, says Brian
      Towin, a physical therapist in Atlanta who specializes in swimming.
      Stave off leg cramps with sprinters' moves: Stand a few feet in front of a wall and, using it as support, step one
      foot back and bend front leg. Switch, then pull each leg to your butt for a quad stretch.
      Prep your back with side bends: Stand with feet together, arms overhead, pressing palms together, and tilt torso
      to each side. For the hsoulders, press palms into the small of your back, fingertips up,
      draw elbows toward each otehr and raise your chest.
      And shoulder rolls work, too, but don't go Micahel Phelps aggressive. Bend elbows at 90 degrees,
      point fingerrtips toward the ceiling, and rotate shoulders in both directions. </p>
    <p class="font-heading-sexydance">2. Relax</p>
    <div class="zumba"><img src="./Images/Image/swimming2.png" alt=""></div>
    <p class="mian-swimming">"Tense muscles sink like rocks, whereas releaxed muscles act more like buoys," says Andey
      Sean kershaw,
      head swim coach at the University of Miami. Just as important is to maintain a neutral positiion with your head,
      shoulders,
      and glutes in a line. It takes strain off your neck and back and helps you swim more gracefully. And it'll cue you
      to stay parallel in the water.
      "Your body works like a teeter-totter—if your head comes up, your hips go down," Kershaw says. Breathing plays a
      key role in this. As you get better at it,
      the pattern becomes its own meditation to keep you chill (and clears your head). </p>
    <p class="font-heading-sexydance">3. Focus on Form</p>
    <p class="mian-swimming">since you took swimming lessons as a kid, there's been a change of thinking on best
      technique, Kershaw says. The pros have traded big, sweeping arm pulls for a tighter, linear patter. Picture your
      body shooting past your hands, the same way you plant your palms on the pool edge and push through your amrs to
      get out of the water. Here's how it's done: Your arm should enter the water just in front of your head, starting
      with teh tip of the middle finger. Extend it straight so your palm faces the bottom of the pool Bend wrist
      slightly like you're reacing into a cookie jar and pull your elbow back along your side, keeping your hand
      parallel to your body. Pair that motion with tight, rolling kicks, keeping legs fairly straight,
      three kicks for each pull (or six kicks per stroke cycle). </p>
    <p class="font-heading-sexydance">4. Go the Distance</p>
    <p class="mian-swimming">Pools are usually short course (25 meters) or Olympic distance (50 meters). Short pools are
      good for aerobic sprint interval training, Mabe says, whereas Olympic ones can help you prep for triathlon or
      open-water swims, since you're going twice as far without a respite. If you find yourself in a longer pool and
      want a high-intensity workout, use the painted marking below you (or on the ceiling if you're doing backstroke)
      to split up the laps between fast bursts and recovery. </p>
    <p class="font-heading-sexydance">5. Float On</p>
    <p class="mian-swimming">Just like a land workout, you'll want ot change things up and isolate different muscle
      groups. A kickboard will help you target legs either during a warm-up or between sprints, Mabe says. Don fins if
      you want your upper body to do the heavy lifting. (And advanced swimmers can practice laps while keeping legs
      still.)</p>
